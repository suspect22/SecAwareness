## Company Campaings
In literature most of the time people talk about "Security-Awareness" while using Names like

* Awareness Programs
* SETA (Security Education and Training Awareness)
* ISAT (Information Security Training)
* User Awareness
* Awareness Training

for the same meaning. These terms should be considered in further researches.
